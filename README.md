# capsnet2D (Old)
Experimental code - tried to implement a convolutional capsule net in TensorFlow based on (Hinton's Dynamic Routing between Capsules)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829]
and (Aurelien Geron's tutorial)[https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/extra_capsnets.ipynb].

# Results
Project has been put on hold for now since network is too slow for real time use cases, which was the original purpose of this exploration.
Also, many implementation mistakes and inefficiencies - not sure if tiling is the way to go.
